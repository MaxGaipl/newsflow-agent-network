# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation about the NewsFlow system architecture.

## Current Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Basic state management with TypedDict
- Linear workflows with simple nodes
- In-memory checkpointing

### Future Phases
- Multi-agent coordination patterns
- Complex state management
- Knowledge graph integration

## Design Decisions

Document your architectural decisions as you progress:

1. **State Management**: Why did you choose certain state structures?
2. **Agent Design**: How did you decide to split responsibilities?
3. **Tool Integration**: What patterns worked best for tool usage?
4. **Performance**: What optimizations did you implement?

## Diagrams

Add system diagrams as the architecture evolves.
