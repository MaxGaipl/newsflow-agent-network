- `phase-4/` - Advanced features

## Template for Learning Notes

For each phase, consider documenting:

1. **Concepts Learned**: What LangGraph/LangChain concepts did you master?
2. **Implementation Challenges**: What was difficult and how did you solve it?
3. **Key Insights**: What "aha" moments did you have?
4. **Next Steps**: What would you explore further?

## Reflection Questions

- How does this concept relate to what I learned before?
- When would I use this pattern in real projects?
- What are the trade-offs of this approach?
- How can I explain this concept to someone else?
